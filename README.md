# Christmas Draw University Project

Given the following scenario: A family consisting of 5 couples decide they don’t
want to buy a Christmas present to everyone in the family but, each member
of the family will buy a nice present to one and only person. The five couples
are as follow:

couple1 = (x1, y1), couple2 = (x2, y2), couple3 = (x3, y3), couple4 = (x4, y4), , couple5(x5, y5)

write a program for their Christmas draw. It should generate two draws; this year and next year’s draw taking
account the following constraint:


• Couples are not allowed to buy for each other .i.e. xi
is not allowed to to
buy for yi and vis-versa

• This year’s draw combinations are not allowed in next year’s draw .i.e. if
xi
is buying for xj , yj this year then xi
is not allowed to buy for xj , yj
next year
